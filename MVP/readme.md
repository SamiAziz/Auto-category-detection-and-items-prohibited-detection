# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
**This folder contained all MVP files, where I tried to explain what I've done as base work for this project.**


## List of files:
- **MVP.jpg** (screenshot of code).
- **MVP.ipynb** (jupyter notebook of code).
- **MVP.pdf** (PDF file with a summary of steps).

## What's next?
1. Try to improve the results.
3. Try to apply different models to compare with.
5. Apply Inception v3. (**with my own computer I don't think so) !**
6. Think of delivering this project as production.
